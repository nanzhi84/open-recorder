# Open Recorder Release Process

This reference explains how the repository release scripts work and how to use them.

## Package scripts

The main dispatcher is:

```bash
pnpm release:dispatch
```

It opens an interactive selector so you can choose:

- `patch`
- `minor`
- `major`

There are also direct wrappers for each release type:

```bash
pnpm release:patch
pnpm release:minor
pnpm release:major
```

Those root package wrappers call the same script with:

- `release:patch` -> `node scripts/dispatch-release-build.mjs --release-type patch`
- `release:minor` -> `node scripts/dispatch-release-build.mjs --release-type minor`
- `release:major` -> `node scripts/dispatch-release-build.mjs --release-type major`

Extra flags can still be passed after `--`:

```bash
pnpm release:patch -- --notes "Bug fixes and stability improvements"
pnpm release:minor -- --name "Open Recorder v1.4.0" --yes
pnpm release:major -- --latest false
```

## Supported dispatcher flags

From `scripts/dispatch-release-build.mjs`:

- `--release-type patch|minor|major`
- `--name VALUE`
- `--notes VALUE`
- `--latest true|false`
- `--yes`
- `--ref VALUE`
- `--repo OWNER/REPO`

## Internal flow

The local dispatcher does the following:

1. Changes into the repo root.
2. Verifies GitHub CLI auth with `gh auth status`.
3. Resolves the repo slug from the `origin` remote unless `--repo` was supplied.
4. Resolves the target branch from `--ref` or the current branch.
5. Dispatches `.github/workflows/release-pr.yml` through `gh workflow run`.
6. Leaves the local worktree untouched.

`.github/workflows/release-pr.yml` then:

1. Checks out the requested base branch.
2. Fetches tags from `origin`.
3. Reads `apps/rust-service/Cargo.toml` for the current version.
4. Looks for the latest local semver tag matching `v*`.
5. Uses the newer of those two versions as the base version.
6. Computes the next version:
   - patch -> increments patch
   - minor -> increments minor and resets patch to `0`
   - major -> increments major and resets minor and patch to `0`
7. Updates all release version files:
   - `apps/rust-service/Cargo.toml`
   - `apps/rust-service/Cargo.lock`
8. Writes `.github/release-plan.json` with:
   - `tagName`
   - `releaseName`
   - `releaseNotes`
   - `makeLatest`
9. Opens or updates the release PR.

## Release workflow behavior after merge

Once the release PR is merged to `main`, `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs automatically.

That workflow:

1. Detects that `apps/rust-service/Cargo.toml` changed on `main`.
2. Confirms the version actually changed.
3. Reads `.github/release-plan.json` for release metadata when it exists.
4. Builds and tests the macOS Swift app and Rust service on Apple Silicon and Intel runners.
5. Packages Apple Silicon and Intel app bundles as ZIP and DMG artifacts.
6. Builds a universal app by merging the native executables with `lipo`, then signs and packages that app as ZIP and DMG artifacts.
7. Uploads the release assets:
   - `open-recorder-macos-arm64.zip`
   - `open-recorder-macos-arm64.dmg`
   - `open-recorder-macos-x64.zip`
   - `open-recorder-macos-x64.dmg`
   - `open-recorder-macos-universal.zip`
   - `open-recorder-macos-universal.dmg`
   - `open-recorder-macos.zip` as a backwards-compatible copy of the universal ZIP
8. Creates or updates the GitHub release with `ncipollo/release-action`.

The Homebrew tap workflow consumes the architecture-specific DMGs. Its generated cask maps Apple Silicon Macs to `open-recorder-macos-arm64.dmg` and Intel Macs to `open-recorder-macos-x64.dmg`; the universal artifacts are intended for direct GitHub downloads when users want one build that runs on both architectures.

The workflow still supports manual `workflow_dispatch` as a fallback, but the normal path is:

1. Run `pnpm release:patch`, `pnpm release:minor`, `pnpm release:major`, or `pnpm release:dispatch`.
2. Let GitHub Actions open or update the release PR.
3. Merge the release PR.
4. Let `.github/workflows/release.yml` publish the release.

## Practical release commands

Use these when you already know the release type:

```bash
pnpm release:patch
pnpm release:minor
pnpm release:major
```

Use this when you want the selector:

```bash
pnpm release:dispatch
```

Use this first if signing secrets still need to be uploaded:

```bash
pnpm release:setup-macos-signing
```

## Common failure modes

- `gh auth status` fails: run `gh auth login`.
- Wrong branch checked out: switch to the branch you intend to base the release PR on, or pass `--ref`.
- Missing signing secrets: run `pnpm release:setup-macos-signing` or configure the required GitHub secrets manually.
- Missing workflow permission: the release PR workflow cannot be dispatched.
- Missing merge step: the release PR exists, but no release is published until that PR is merged to `main`.
